This is the 2 sample automated test cases performed with Selenium WebDriver and Python 3.
Test cases are taken from live project test documentation to demonstrate my Selenium WebDriver
basic skills.
As Im a new in test automation, there are few inaccuracies in the presented code:
  1. time.sleep() method is used to handle AJAX screen in main container
  2. Some of the locators can be absolute, not relative (and with cyrrilic alphabet somewhere)
  3. You may find any other inaccuracies which I didn't notice
  
 Sincerely, Pavel Bogoboyazov
